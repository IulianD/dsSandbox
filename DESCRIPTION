Description: Overrides the datashield.login function in the opal package in order to allow
    the creation of pseudo-connections that live in the local sessions. All the opal and datashield
    functions operate seamlessly on these in the same way as on the normal, remote nodes.
    Furthemore it is possible to mix local pseudo-connections with remote real connections in the same
    opal object, enabling the virtual pooling of local and remote data.
